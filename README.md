# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

    Our overall approach to this project was divide and conquer and clear communication. We both would decide on some tasks that need to be completed for the game and work to complete those individually. After those sections were completed we would update the other person and move onto our next task to complete or ask if they had any ideas of next steps to be completed. This meant that we ran into very few errors when it came to git because we often were not writing over each others code because we were working on different sections. We wanted to create a fun game with an engaging story and a little bit of comedy and humor. We did a lot of story building with aspects of the golf team, and notes, as well as suprising dialogue from teachers and students. We wanted the world to feel quite large and interactive so we hid lot's of items in the large school and had descriptions for almost everything which included some lore and made the world feel whole. We wanted the game to be suspensful so we added a thrill of danger with the enemies who move autonomosly and may be lurking and following you, and a jump scare noise if the player dies. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

    We learned better how Array's and Array lists interact with each other and work as java classes. We used them a lot when going between user input and a array list of strings that is easy to parse through to actually run the inputted commands. Additionally, we learned how to work with sound in java. We have our own class to run the sound in AudioPlayWav.java and two sound files in AudioLaughter.wav and AudioScream.wav. We use the method playAudio() to play a jump scare sound when our player dies. 

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?





 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

    If we had unlimited time, we would've implemented a respawn method. This method could respawn you when your player dies in the current phase you are at, or respawn you at the beginning of the game. This would be helpful because right now when you die or win you must restart the whole game, and since our game is quite hard and long. The lack of a respawn can be annoying if a user is struggling but determined to finish the game.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?



 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

    Do not fall behind! The final project is a large undertaking and your best coding is often done in small chunks with breaks in between! Working
    a little bit at a time will lead to better more thoughout code instead of rushed or tired late night coding. Working and debugging a little bit everyday helps the project feel more digestable and can alleviate a lot of stress! Additionally, start with coding the main method and work out from there, this helps avoid writing confusing redundant methods. Additionally, make sure you have a clear plan before starting coding on how everything interacts and what methods each class will have. It is okay to add to this plan as needed but a clear plan at the beginning will help make sure all project partners are on the same page.
